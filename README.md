# Visuospatial-Attention
SYDE556 Project

## How you can attend to different parts of an image without moving your eyes?
For the final project, I designed a model where control neurons are used to attend to different parts of an image without moving the eyes. When looking at an image, attention isn’t focused on the whole image, but parts of it. For controlling which parts of an image will be attended, control neurons will be used to control center of the receptive field, similar to Bobier et al. Mechanistic Model of Selective Attention in Spiking Neurons [1].
